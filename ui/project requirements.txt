PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
Create a website where any visitor can see the up to date list of available flights
The list of available flights must be updated in real time
Allow a user to create a profile and log in to that profile
If a user logs in, allow them to search for flights between an origin and destination city
The results of this search must be updated in real time
The app must find a flight or series of flights (in the case of layovers) that will get the user from the origin to the destination the fastest
A layover of zero is not valid
If there is no possible route, the user must be made aware that they cannot travel to that destination from their origin at this time
Once an itinerary is presented to the user, the user must be given the option to book the itinerary
The user must have a page that displays all of their previously booked itineraries, the total flight time, and the total layover time
The user must be given the option to view their booked itinerary on a map as provided by the MapController
In the scenario of a multi-flight itinerary, lines must be displayed with a different color for each branch of the journey
Information must be provided on the map template page that shows the user the order the line segments occur in, the flight time for that segment, and the layover time in each particular city
